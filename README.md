## 📖 Overview

**Frosty** is an advanced Magisk/KernelSU/APatch module that optimizes your Android device by selectively freezing unnecessary Google Mobile Services (GMS) components and enabling deep battery optimization.

Unlike other optimizers, Frosty gives you **granular control** over which service categories to disable, allowing you to balance battery savings with functionality.

**Based on the work of [GhostGMS](https://github.com/kaushikieeee/GhostGMS)**

### Why Frosty?

- 🔋 **Massive Battery Savings** - Disable power-hungry GMS services that run 24/7
- 💤 **GMS Doze Integration** - Force Android to optimize GMS battery usage
- 🎯 **Selective Control** - Choose exactly which features to keep or freeze
- ⚡ **Kernel Optimizations** - Optional scheduler, VM, and network tweaks
- 🔄 **Fully Reversible** - Toggle between Frozen and Stock modes instantly
- 📊 **Detailed Logging** - Know exactly what's happening on your device


## ✨ Features

### 🧊 GMS Service Freezing
Disable Google services organized into 8 logical categories:
- **Telemetry** - Ads, analytics, tracking (safe to disable)
- **Background** - Updates, background sync (safe to disable)
- **Location** - GPS, geofencing, activity recognition
- **Connectivity** - Chromecast, Quick Share, Nearby
- **Cloud** - Backup, sync, authentication
- **Payments** - Google Pay, Wallet, NFC
- **Wearables** - Wear OS, Google Fit
- **Games** - Play Games achievements, cloud saves

### 💤 GMS Doze
Based on [Universal GMS Doze](https://github.com/gloeyisk/universal-gms-doze) by gloeyisk:
- **XML Patching** - Removes GMS from power-save whitelists
- **DeviceIdle Integration** - Allows Android Doze to optimize GMS
- **Conflict Resolution** - Patches other modules that whitelist GMS
- **Toggleable** - Enable/disable with the action button

### ⚡ System Optimizations
- **Kernel Tweaks** - Scheduler, VM, and network optimizations
- **Blur Disable** - Reduce GPU load by disabling UI blur effects
- **Log Killing** - Stop battery-draining log processes (logcat, traced, etc.)
- **Empty RC Files** - Overlay system init scripts to prevent debug daemons

### 📱 User Experience
- **Volume Key Selection** - Easy installation choices
- **Action Button Toggle** - Switch modes from root manager
- **Comprehensive Logs** - Detailed logs in `/data/adb/modules/Frosty/logs/`
- **Status Report** - Quick status check via terminal
- **Clean Uninstall** - Complete reversal of all changes

## ❓ FAQ

### Q: My notifications are delayed after enabling GMS Doze
**A:** This is expected. GMS Doze allows Android to optimize GMS battery usage, which may slightly delay push notifications. If this is a problem: **disable GMS Doze during installation**.

### Q: Google Maps doesn't work
**A:** You froze the Location category. Use the action button to switch to Stock mode, or reinstall and skip the Location category.

### Q: Can I change settings after installation?

### Q: How do I know it's working?
**A:** Check the log files.

### Q: What's the difference between Frozen and Stock mode?
| Mode | Services | GMS Doze | Kernel Tweaks |
|------|----------|----------|---------------|
